## Description
This app helps users create ReadMe files quickly. It prompts the user with specific and standard questions about their project and turns their inputs into a well formatted ReadMe.md file. 

This project will help people quickly create the ReadMe files they need to document their project. It's a simply file that's also imporant, so this app makes it as easy as possible to make the file. While creating it, I learned that it's important to not overthink projects.

## Installation
Open the file in the GitHub, download the code and open it. Using the command line, run the file and generate the ReadMe.


## Usage
The app will prompt the user with questions, so the user only has to answer the questions. Aside from that, the user only has to open the ReadMe-Generator and then, after answering the prompting questions, open their created ReadMe.

## Credits
My tutor, Jude Clark, was helpful when creating this.

## Features
Main feature is the prompted questions and conditional statments that customize what's included in the ReadMe depending on the user's input. For example, if the user doesn't supply a badge, the badge section doesn't appear.
